        <p style="margin-bottom: 1rem; margin-left: -21px"><strong>How Savings Goals Works</strong></p>

        <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your Elite Community Savings Goals allows you to set up to 5
                goals at a time to save towards e.g. holiday, car etc. Based on the amount you choose to save, you will
                be allocated to one of the tiers below:
            </span>
            <ul>
                <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Based on the amount you choose to save,
                        you will be allocated to one of the tiers from above
                    </span></li>
                <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can choose to make one-off savings, or
                        a specific amount based on
                        frequency, which will be auto-debited (e.g. N100 daily or N20,000 monthly).</span></li>
                <li style="font-weight: 400;">
                    <span style="font-weight: 400;">You can set maturity dates according to
                        the chosen tier</span>

                    <p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tier 1 - 30 days, 60 days, 90
                            days&nbsp;</span></p>
                    <p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tier 2 - 60 days, 90 days, 6
                            months, 1 year</span></p>
                    <p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tier 3 - 90 days, 6 months, 1
                            year, 2 years</span></p>

                </li>
                <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You will only be able to access funds in
                        your Elite Community Savings Goals after the maturity period for your chosen tier has elapsed.
                    </span></li>
                <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">When your set maturity date has elapsed,
                        you can request withdrawal of funds to your Elite Community current account and be credited on the same
                        day. You may also decide to roll over your funds by setting a new maturity date.</span></li>
            </ul>
        </li>

        <p style="margin-bottom: 1rem; margin-left: -21px"><strong>Interest and Charges</strong></p>

        <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">We will provide you with the rates of interest
                and charges that apply to the Saving Goals product, and your account generally, at the time of
                account opening. You hereby authorize Elite Community to impose from time to time service charges and such
                other charges on your account.</span></li>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>

        <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Interest is calculated on each whole Naira in
                the account and not on the kobo. Interest accruing to your account is calculated on a daily basis
                using the annual interest rate divided by 365 days. In a leap year, interest will be calculated on a
                daily basis using the annual interest rate divided by 366 days. You will receive interest on your
                account on a monthly basis in the following month after the month in which the interest was
                earned.</span></li>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>

        <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">To ensure our interest rates are consistent
                and competitive, or to reflect changes to external benchmark interest rates such as the CBN Monetary
                Policy Rate, or to enable us to manage the overall costs to us of raising the money we lend to our
                customers we will, from time to time make changes to the interest rates applicable to your Savings
                Goals. We may also introduce, remove or change interest rate tiering (i.e. where a different
                interest rate applies depending on your account balance) and the applicable maturity periods.</span>
        </li>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>

        <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">When we make changes to the interest rate on
                your Savings Goals, we will advise you of the new applicable rates by email or by publication on our
                website at least 14 days before such new rate comes into effect.</span></li>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>

        <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sometimes we may decide to discontinue certain
                products, close certain types of accounts, or we may move your account to a different product. If we
                have to do this, we will always give you at least 30 days' notice of the change, together with
                information and the terms and conditions applicable to the substitute account. If you do not want to
                move to the substitute account, you will have the right to close your account during the notice
                period.</span></li>
